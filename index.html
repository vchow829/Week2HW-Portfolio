      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of Washington State University and obtained a BA in Sport Management with a minor in Business Administration. Throughout my career, I have had many stops working with professional organizations ranging from Minor League Baseball and Major League Baseball, Division I athletic departments, and the National Hockey League. The bulk of my experience has been in ticket operations, which is quite niche prompting me to acquire and learn new skills in web development with the hope of expanding career opportunities. While I am new to this experience and this is my first page build, I am confident that I will learn and be knowledgeable to succeed as a web developer.
